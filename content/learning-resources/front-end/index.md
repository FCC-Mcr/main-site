The practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.

This is what the user of your web app or static website will see, and interact with - kinda like the stars of the show on stage.

## **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets)

Breaking this word up into smaller parts, lets start with the phase 'Style Sheets'.

**Style Sheets :** During the earlier days of the internet, HTML only allowed for very little style of it's web pages, and only allowed for inline styling, written within the same file. Nowadays, these style sheets, are files that segregated from HTML files, and can be easily added anytime.

**Cascading :** This word represents how the styles are organised, when both styles for the same selector is made, the latest change to that style will be the one most prominant - the one that actually gets used.

### **ES6**

Learn ES6 the Dope Way.

ES6 short for (ECMAScript 6, more fondly known as ECMAScript 2015 - was released that year). Lets again, break this up.

ECMAScript is the standard implementation of what is widely known as JavaScript, however the name JavaScript came from it's inventor Brendan Eich.

When his boss asked him one day to create a language for it, using some of the object orientated implementation of the language hot at the time (1995) 'Java'.

However the official name of the new standard of this langauge is called ECMAScript; the new naming is derived from a long arduous history of the language's inception, and corporate war between Microsoft's JScript and NetScape's JavaScript language standards

Not going to go into any more depth, the story to take from this is that having 2 or more competiting standards for a technology is usually bad for industry.

### **React**

React is a view library created by Facebook, that frontend devs utilize. Due to it's rapid ability to render only particular parts of the page when it's required - known as dynamically generating elements.

In the past, whenever some part of the page has changed,even if it was a single letter, the whole page has to be reload. Where as react can load in that tiny change, for that single letter, without having to reload the entire page
